# KneeReplacement
I've created a Knee Replacement website that includes two navigation bars, different sections providing information and i have also made a sticky form if the user require any help?.
Aditionaly there is a  section for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) followed by informative Owl Carousels and a footer.
This website offers valuable information and resources related to knee replacement surgery.

I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Owl Carousel
